# P2P-Energy-Trading-Sample
Sample P2P Energy Trade using Python
This code defines two classes: User and Market. The User class represents an energy producer or consumer who can buy and sell energy with other users. Each user has a name, a balance (in some currency), and an amount of energy. Users can buy and sell energy with other users using the buy_energy and sell_energy methods, which take a User object representing the other party, the amount of energy to buy or sell, and the price per unit of energy.

The Market class represents the energy market, which is simply a collection of users. The add_user method adds a user to the market, and the get_user method retrieves a user by name.

Of course, this is a very basic outline and doesn't include features such as user authentication, secure communication, or regulation compliance. However, it should give you an idea of how a peer-to-peer energy trading system could be implemented in Python.
